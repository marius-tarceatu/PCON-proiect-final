# One_Button_Looper
It is a M4L device that controls Ableton Live and launches clips that you can loop.

## You need to drag the .amxd file to your Ableton Live. After you have it there, for example in personal files, you must load it up on the main channel(master).
...

## Best use case is to midi map it to a button from a midi controller, or a note on the keyboard that you do not use.

After that everytime you press it, it will trigger an event.

First is to arm the first track, next to play. This is the only time it will be a cycle of 2.

Then it will be cycle of 3. Press once, it selects next track, press the second time, it arms the next track, press the thirs time and it will launch the first clip in this track.

It works in Session View of Ableton Live.
